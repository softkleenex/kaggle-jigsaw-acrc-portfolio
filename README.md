**üá∫üá∏ English Version** | [üá∞üá∑ ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ Î≤ÑÏ†Ñ](README_KR.md)

> **A Case Study in Hypothesis-Driven Problem Solving Under Competition Constraints**

## Executive Summary

**Competition:** [Jigsaw - Agile Community Rules Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-agile-community-rules)
**Team Size:** Solo
**Final Rank:** 1,121 / 2,444 (Top 46%)
**Final Score:** 0.904 ROC-AUC
**Timeline:** ~20 hours over 5 days (Oct 20-24, 2024)
**Tech Stack:** DeBERTa-v3-base, Qwen 2.5 1.5B-Instruct, LoRA, PEFT, Transformers

### The Core Challenge

This is **not** a medal-winning solution. This is a technical deep-dive demonstrating:

- ‚úÖ **Hypothesis-driven debugging** under time pressure (2-hour time-boxes)
- ‚úÖ **Deep technical investigation** of LoRA adapter compatibility issues
- ‚úÖ **Strategic pivoting** when approaches fail (3 major pivots in 5 days)
- ‚úÖ **Honest self-assessment** and systematic learning documentation
- ‚úÖ **Production-relevant skills**: These debugging patterns transfer directly to production ML

### Why This Portfolio Matters

**Most portfolios show successes. This shows how to debug failures systematically.**

When a Qwen 2.5 1.5B model with public LoRA weights produced degenerate outputs (all 0.0 predictions) despite 100% parsing success, I didn't give up or randomly tweak hyperparameters. I:

1. **Collected evidence** from adapter configs, dataset names, and model outputs
2. **Ranked hypotheses** by probability (base model mismatch: 80%, training methodology mismatch: 60%, prompt format mismatch: 40%)
3. **Identified root cause** through systematic elimination
4. **Documented learnings** for future reference

This is the debugging process engineering teams value in production environments.

## Key Findings & Takeaways

### Finding 1: Config Files Can Mislead
**Discovery:** mahmoudmohamed adapter's `adapter_config.json` claimed `base_model_name_or_path: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"`, but the dataset was named `reddit-4b-think`, suggesting training on Qwen 4B.

**Implication:** Always cross-reference config files with dataset metadata, file sizes, and training artifacts. Don't trust configs alone.

**Evidence:** seojinpark adapter explicitly specified `"Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4"` with matching training pickles (train.pkl: 5.9MB, val.pkl: 726KB).

---

### Finding 2: 100% Parse Success ‚â† Correct Model Behavior
**Discovery:** Tier 1 v2 achieved 100% successful parsing of model outputs as floats between 0.0-1.0, but all values were exactly 0.0.

**Implication:** The model WAS responding to prompts correctly (not a parsing bug), but intentionally outputting degenerate values due to adapter-base mismatch.

**Learning:** Validate actual model behavior, not just parsing success rates.

---

### Finding 3: Time-Boxing Prevents Analysis Paralysis
**Strategy:** Allocated 2-hour blocks for each major attempt:
- Tier 1 v1 (mahmoudmohamed adapter): 2 hours
- Tier 1 v2 (ultra-structured prompts): 2 hours
- Tier 1 v3 (seojinpark adapter): Planned but competition ended

**Result:** Prevented spending 20+ hours debugging a fundamentally incompatible approach. Preserved time for alternative strategies.

**Industry Relevance:** This mirrors production sprint planning where you need to make progress vs. perfect decisions.

---

### Finding 4: Public Resources Require Validation
**Challenge:** 15+ public Qwen LoRA adapters were available on Kaggle, but only ~20% explicitly matched base models correctly.

**Learning:** When using public model weights:
1. Check adapter config base model path
2. Verify dataset naming conventions
3. Look for training artifacts (pkl files, logs)
4. Test on small examples before full inference

## Approach Timeline

### Phase 1: Baseline Establishment (Oct 20-21)
**Approach:** DeBERTa-v3-base fine-tuning
**Result:** 0.904 ROC-AUC
**Status:** ‚úÖ Successful baseline, competitive with middle-tier solutions
**Code:** *(Referenced in existing repository notebooks)*

### Phase 2: Public LoRA Discovery (Oct 21)
**Trigger:** Analysis of Discussion forum and public datasets
**Discovery:** 15+ public Qwen LoRA adapters available (mahmoudmohamed, seojinpark, etc.)
**Strategy Pivot:** Attempt inference-only with public weights to bypass NumPy compatibility issues
**Time Investment:** 2 hours research

### Phase 3: Tier 1 v1 - First Qwen Attempt (Oct 22)
**Approach:** mahmoudmohamed adapter with basic prompt engineering
**Code:** *(v1 notebook not preserved, see v2 for evolved version)*
**Result:** ‚ùå All predictions = 0.0
**Hypothesis:** Prompt engineering insufficient
**Time Investment:** 2 hours

### Phase 4: Tier 1 v2 - Ultra-Structured Prompts (Oct 22)
**Approach:** Complete prompt overhaul with chat templates
**Improvements:**
1. System/user message separation
2. Few-shot numerical examples (0.95, 0.23, 0.78...)
3. Temperature: 0.01 (deterministic)
4. 3-stage robust parsing (direct float ‚Üí regex ‚Üí keyword fallback)

**Code:** [`notebooks/tier1_v2_ultra_structured/qwen_tier1_v2.ipynb`](notebooks/tier1_v2_ultra_structured/qwen_tier1_v2.ipynb)
**Result:** ‚ùå All predictions = 0.0 (but 100% parse success!)
**Root Cause Identified:** Base model mismatch (see [Failure Analysis](FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md))
**Time Investment:** 2 hours

### Phase 5: Competition End (Oct 24)
**Planned:** Tier 1 v3 with seojinpark fold3 adapter (correct base model match)
**Status:** ‚è±Ô∏è Competition ended before execution
**Final Rank:** 1,121 / 2,444 with DeBERTa baseline

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. LoRA Adapter Compatibility Matrix

| Adapter | Base Model Claim | Evidence | Compatibility | Result |
|---------|-----------------|----------|---------------|--------|
| mahmoudmohamed | Qwen 1.5B-Instruct | Dataset name: "reddit-**4b**-think" | ‚ùå Likely mismatch | All 0.0 |
| seojinpark fold3 | Qwen 1.5B-Instruct-**GPTQ-Int4** | Has train.pkl (5.9MB), val.pkl (726KB) | ‚úÖ Explicit match | Not tested |

**Lesson:** Dataset naming conventions and training artifacts matter more than config files.

---

### 2. Prompt Engineering Evolution

**v1 Prompt:** Basic instruction
```python
prompt = f"""You are a content moderator.
Determine if the following post violates the given rule.

Rule: {rule}
Post: {body}

Probability:"""
```

**v2 Prompt:** Ultra-structured with chat template
```python
system = "You are a precise AI. Respond ONLY with a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0."

user = f"""Analyze if this post violates the rule.

RULE: {rule}
POST: {body}

Respond with ONLY a number between 0.0 and 1.0:
Examples: 0.95, 0.23, 0.78, 0.02

Your answer (number only):"""

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": system},
    {"role": "user", "content": user}
]
```

**Result:** Improved from unclear outputs to consistent 0.0 ‚Üí **Proved the issue wasn't prompt format.**

---

### 3. Root Cause Hypothesis Ranking

| Hypothesis | Confidence | Evidence | Validation |
|------------|-----------|----------|------------|
| A: Base model mismatch (4B adapter on 1.5B base) | **80%** | Dataset name "4b-think", dimension incompatibility | Would need seojinpark test |
| B: Training for binary classification (0/1) vs continuous (0.0-1.0) | 60% | Consistent 0.0 outputs, "safe" boundary value | Possible but less likely |
| C: Prompt format mismatch with training methodology | 40% | 100% parse success suggests format OK | Unlikely given evidence |

**Next Step (If More Time):** Test seojinpark adapter to confirm Hypothesis A.

## Reflections

### What Went Well
1. ‚úÖ Established competitive baseline quickly (DeBERTa: 0.904)
2. ‚úÖ Discovered valuable public resources through Discussion analysis
3. ‚úÖ Systematic hypothesis-driven debugging
4. ‚úÖ Time-boxed decision making prevented analysis paralysis
5. ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation of failures for learning

### What Could Be Improved
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Should have validated adapter compatibility BEFORE implementing full inference pipeline
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Could have tested small examples (3-5 samples) before full test set inference
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Spent too much time on prompt engineering when issue was deeper (adapter mismatch)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Should have checked competition deadline more carefully (thought I had more time)

### Key Professional Takeaways
1. **Validate assumptions early** - Test on small examples before scaling
2. **Cross-reference evidence** - Don't trust single sources (configs, dataset names, etc.)
3. **Time-box investigations** - 2-hour blocks prevent diminishing returns
4. **Document failures** - More valuable than success stories for learning
5. **Hypothesis ranking** - Assign probabilities to focus investigation
